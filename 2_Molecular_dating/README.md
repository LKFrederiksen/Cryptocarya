# Dating the phylogeny with BEAST

[BEAST]() (Drummond, ) based on Bayesian inference was used to date the phylogenetic tree. To do this we used the three best nuclear genes, nine fossils (primary calibrations) and one secondary calibration on the root (see Table ... in [MSc thesis]()). Moreover, we fixed the tree topology to that of the ASTRAL tree based on 34. nuclear genes. 

We selected the fossils based on [Ramirez-Barahona et al., 2022]() and the fossils included in [Li et al. (2020)](), except _Cryptocaryoxylon gippslandicum_.
