# Cryptocarya

  # These are workflows for reproducing the analysis I will conduct during my MSc project at Aarhus University on the Cryptocarya group (Lauraceae). The workflows will include:
    # 1. Bioinformatics workflow to reproduce generated ASTRAL species tree of Cryptocarya, using the Angiosperm 353 probe set.
    # 2. Workflow to date the species tree using BEAST.
    # 3. Biogeographical analyses using BioGeoBEARS to explore dispersal patterns.
