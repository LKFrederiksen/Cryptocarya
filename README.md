# **Cryptocarya group**

This repository contains all the scripts, including workflows I used to conduct my analyses, during my MSc thesis at Aarhus University. Additionally, the supplementary information for an article manuscript. The submitted MSc thesis can be read [here]().

During my thesis I studied the Cryptocarya group (Lauraceae), a pantropical group mainly linked to tropical rainforest (TRF), consisting of probably >3500 species. The focus of my thesis was understanding where the Cryptocarya group most likely originated and when, where and how this group achieved its pantropical distribution.
The thesis is structured in two parts: 
- Part A is a general introduction of the subjects treated in this thesis, which does not include any scripts.
- Part B is the article manuscripy entitled ".Ã¦..."
    - The supplementary information can be found [here]().
    - See below for a description of the workflows used to conduct the analyses:

The workflows include:
     
     1. Bioinformatics workflow to reproduce generated ASTRAL species tree of the      Cryptocarya group, using the Angiosperms353 probe set (see [Johnson et al., 2018]()).
     
     2. Workflow to date the species tree using BEAST.
      
     3. Biogeographical analyses using BioGeoBEARS to explore dispersal patterns.
