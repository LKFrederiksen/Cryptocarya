**Appendix S1: Paralog analyses from HybPiper**
[HybPiper](https://bioone.org/journals/applications-in-plant-sciences/volume-4/issue-7/apps.1600016/HybPiper--Extracting-Coding-Sequence-and-Introns-for-Phylogenetics-from/10.3732/apps.1600016.full) generated output showing potential paralogs for each gene and number of gene duplications for each sample. 0 indicates no genes recovered for the specific sample, 1 indicates gene recovered for the sample, >1 indicated that the gene potentially is paralogous.

**Appendix_S2: Gene tree concordance to 'PAFTOL' outgroup topology**
Nuclear [Angiosperms353](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535394) (Johnson et al., 2019) genes used to generate the [PAFTOL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983440) (Baker et al., 2022) outgroup topology. We used SortaDate [(Smith et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29772020) to identify the supercontig genes that were most concordant to the PAFTOL outgroup topology based on exons [(Baker et al., 2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983440). We then tested how many exons we were able to substitute with supercontigs without losing the desired topology used in [Ramirez-Barahona (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1241-3). This was 10%. The genes in the supercontig table are the 10% most concordant genes, whereas the genes in the exon table are the remaining 90 %.

**Appendix S4: Dispersal rate scalers for BioGeoBEARS** 
Adapted from [Toussaint et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12977). Dispersal rate scaling matrices used in the `BioGeoBEARS` [(Matzke, 2013)](https://escholarship.org/content/qt44j7n141/qt44j7n141_noSplash_a25fcfcd2e4c86c599d6f7da5ee1d7f8.pdf?t=pga0we) analyses from the oldest time slice to the newest (TS1 to TS3). A matrix of dispersal rate scalers relative to potential geographic barriers is given for each of the three time slices: 80 to 40 Ma, 40 to 20 Ma and 20 Ma to present. Four symbols are used to indicate the kind of barrier between the selected ranges. Regions are abbreviated as follows: A = Andean-Argentinian, B = Neotropical, C = Southern Africa, D = African, E = Madagascan, F = Northern Australia, G = Malesian, H = Indian-Indochinese, I = Neozealandic-Patagonian and J = Eurasiatic (see [Carta et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9298788/)).

**Appendix S6: Gene trees**
342 ML (maximum likelihood) gene trees generated with IQtree in Newick format. Each gene tree corresponds to one gene. The faster headers correspond to each individual in short notation.

The columns in the table correspond to: Sample name , Number of reads,	Number of reads on target, Percentage of reads on target,	Number of genes with reads,	Number of genes with contigs,	Number of genes with sequences,	Number of genes with sequences > 25% of the target length, Number of genes with sequences > 50% of the target length, Number of genes with sequences > 75% of the target length, Number of genes with sequences < 150% of the target length, Number of genes with paralog warnings. See [HybPiper wiki](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki#hybpiper-stats) for an explanation of what the different outputs mean.

ASTRAL [(Zhang et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5998893/) species tree including ingroup and outgroup for all samples (also species with multiple samples) with quartet scores (QS). The quartet scores are included as pies on each node. Red = main topology, turquoise = alternative topology, grey = second alternative topology.

**Appendix S10: Species tree with quartet scores** 
ASTRAL [(Zhang et al., 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5998893/) species tree including ingroup and outgroup for all samples (also species with multiple samples) with local posterior probability scores (LPP) showing the support for the main branch topology. The LPP scores can span from 0 to 1, where LPP = 1 indicates maximum support for the specific branch.

**``Appendix_S11.pdf``**

**Appendix S11: Biogeograchic ancestral range estimation using BioGeoBEARS including range probability scores**
Ancestral range estimation for the Cryptocarya group using BioGeoBEARS based on the DEC+TS+_j_ model, with ancestral ranges, and [dispersal rate scalers]() between regions for each time slice (TS1, TS2, TS3). Roman numerals on the nodes represent crown nodes of important colonisation events, discussed in the text and shown in Table 4. Pies on the nodes and branches show the probality of each range, based on 1. These ranges can comprise of one to three combined regions, as indicated by single letters or a combination of these (e.g., FG = Northern Australia and Malesia). Regions are abbreviated as follows: A = Andean-Argentinian, B = Neotropical, C = Southern Africa, D = African, E = Madagascan, F = Northern Australia, G = Malesian, H = Indian-Indochinese, I = Neozealandic-Patagonian and J = Eurasiatic (see [Carta et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9298788/). Three modes of range inheritance (range expansion, local extinction, and narrow vicariance) are indicated as symbols on branches in the phylogeny. Biogeographic events: KP + GR disintegration = Kerguelen Plateau and Gunnerus Ridge disintegration, KPME = Cretaceousâ€“Palaeogene mass extinction, NALB = North, Atlantic Land Bridge, EECO = Cenozoic thermal maxima, Australian-Antarctic split = No longer a land connection between Australia and Antarctica,  Plates = Australian and Pacific plate collides.

**``Appendix_S12.xlsx``**

**Appendix S12: BioGeoBEARS dispersal sinks and sources**
Number of dispersal (range expansion, e; jump dispersal, _j_) events for the three time slices (see Figure 3; 80 Ma, 40 Ma, 20 Ma and 0 Ma) from the DEC+TS+j model (see Table 3). Counts of events were averaged across the 100 biogeographic stochastic mappings (BSMs) with standard deviations in parentheses. Rows represent source ranges; columns represent dispersal sinks. Darker shades indicate a higher frequency of dispersal events. The sum and percent of events in each row and column are given on the margins. Regions are abbreviated as follows: A = Andean-Argentinian, B = Neotropical, C = Southern Africa, D = African, E = Madagascan, F = Northern Australia, G = Malesian, H = Indian-Indochinese, I = Neozealandic-Patagonian and J = Eurasiatic.
