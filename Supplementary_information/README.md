# Supplementary information for the article manuscript ["Long-distance dispersal shaped the pantropical distribution of the geographically structured Cryptocarya group"]() from the MSc thesis of Laura Kragh Frederiksen.

## DATA

**``Data_S1.zip``**

**Data S1: Alignments**
342 fasta files generated with MAFFT and trimmed with Trimal, Optrimal, CIalign and Taper. Each file represents one gene retrieved from the ['mega353' target file](https://github.com/chrisjackson-pellicle/NewTargets) (McLay et al., 2021). The faster headers correspond to each individual in short notation. See attached [text file]() for a conversion of the short notation to the species name.

**``Data_S2.zip``**

**Data S2: Gene trees**
342 ML (maximum likelihood) gene trees generated with IQtree in Newick format. Each gene tree corresponds to one gene. The faster headers correspond to each individual in short notation. See attached [text file]() for a conversion of the short notation to the species name.

**Table S1: Gene tree concordance to 'PAFTOL' outgroup topology**
Nuclear [Angiosperms353](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535394) (Johnson et al., 2019) genes used to generate the [PAFTOL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983440) (Baker et al., 2022) outgroup topology. We used [SortaDate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29772020) (Smith et al., 2018) to identify the supercontig genes that were most concordant to the PAFTOL outgroup topology based on exons (Baker et al., 2022). We then tested how many exons we were able to substitute with supercontigs without losing the desired topology used in [Ramirez-Barahona (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1241-3). This was 10%. The genes in the supercontig table are the 10% most concordant genes, whereas the genes in the exon table are the remaining 90 %.
